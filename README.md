Coding Challenge

For the working code of all the pieces look at the index.js and test.js files to see what I did.  I tested everything using Postman to see the results of the code I wrote.  To duplicate copy all directory packages, open Postman and send the request with values for passwords that fit and do not fit the requirements.  
I checked every edge case with these three tests:
1. NO capital letter, length requirement met, numeric character met
2. Captital letter, length requirement NOT met, numeric character met
3. Capital letter, length requirement met, numeric character NOT met
